<!--
  @fileoverview Load html-imports here until all dependencies are in NPM.
  link[rel=import] elements assume that the element will be hosted in
  bower_components.

  For use with npm, bower dependencies must be loaded beforehand when using
  LitElement modules. A proposed workflow is:

  1. Work as usual using webpack, es6 modules
  2. Run emit-bower-dependencies to get the flattened bower dependency map of
  the package.
  3. Install bower dependencies and vulcanize.
