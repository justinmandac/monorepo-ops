# Mono App Header

## Usage

### Alongside Bower Packages
Use html-imports when this component as a Bowe dependency.

```
<link rel="import" href="../mono-app-header/mono-app-header.html>"
```

### Using with npm
Add to your project using es6 imports.

```
import MonoAppHeader from 'mono-app-header/mono-app-header.js';
```
However, this doesn't include the html-imports that are needed by the component.
